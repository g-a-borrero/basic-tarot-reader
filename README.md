# basic-tarot-reader
A very basic app for dealing Tarot cards. Made with Tkinter, random, and copy.

## Note of Discomfort

I have used the name "Romani" for the 21-card layout. I have seen this called the Romany, Romani, and Gypsy layout. If there is a better name for this layout, please reach out to me immediately.
